About the datasets
Concrete_strength:-ata Characteristics:
    
The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a 
specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled). 

Summary Statistics: 

Number of instances (observations): 1030
Number of Attributes: 9
Attribute breakdown: 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable
Missing Attribute Values: None

Variable Information:

Given is the variable name, variable type, the measurement unit and a brief description. 
The concrete compressive strength is the regression problem. The order of this listing 
corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Parkinson's Disease Telemonitoring Dataset
DATA SET INFORMATION:

This dataset is composed of a range of biomedical voice measurements from 42 
people with early-stage Parkinson's disease recruited to a six-month trial of 
a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The 
recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.

Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, 
time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 
16 biomedical voice measures. Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice 
recording from these individuals. The main aim of the data is to predict the 
motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 
voice measures.
